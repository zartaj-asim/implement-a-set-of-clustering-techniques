# implement-a-set-of-clustering-techniques


Task 1:
Calculation Correlation Matrix


Task 2:
 Permute the Data Matrix
o Do this by shuffling the individual rows in the dataset.
 Display color coded image of permuted Data Matrix
Recover the image clusters using Signature technique. The method to generate the signature is as 
under
o Sum all the values in a row
o Calculate mean of the row
o Multiply the Sum of the row with its Mean
o The above three step produces a signature for a row
 Rearrange (sort) the Similarity Matrix by signature value of each row.
 Apply Task1 on the rearranged matrix
 Display the color coded image
 
 
 Task 4:
 Also submit a write-up with following
o Explaining each step
o Screenshots
o Comparison of task 2 and 3
o Work distribution among group members
